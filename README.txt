The angular project structure for this project seemed more modular, whereas the Express HTML customer facing page seemed to operate through a series of controllers, databases, routes, and views.

To test the API, the user needs to log-in using their credentials. Once compared to the database, they are logged in. Once they’re successfully credentialed, we need to confirm that both the login page and dashboard are accessible. Upon confirmation of this, the app reads the database info to the user. I feel like the most common error someone could run into is not having the proper login. The app will deny you access, whether it’s hacking or simply someone forgetting their login information.

MongoDB is more scalable than its SQL counterparts. It’s much easier to install and implement on a smaller scale, but should our application grow, it will be easier to grow our backend as well.
JSON is just used as a dictionary of sorts. We use it in the app to transmit to the database, as well as provide data to the frontend. JavaScript is a programming language used to achieve these data pipelines. A good example of refactoring code is when we implemented handlebars views, and subsequently went through the code to refactor. 

This was my first 400 level course. It was incredibly interesting watching how all of these pieces I've been working so hard on over the years finally fit together. I think it's helpful for all CS students, as many of us aren't sure which direction we'd like to pursue after graduating. Being able to work on everything from front end, back end, databases, and security, it gave some valuable insight as to my future plans. I think being able to get hands on with popular frameworks like Angular and Express has made me a much more marketable job candidate. 

Thanks for reading!
